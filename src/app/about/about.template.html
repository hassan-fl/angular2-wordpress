<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Hassan. 
    I started software development with C++ and VB6 When I was a university student. In the 2000s DotNet Platform was a more popular technology for creating web-based applications. So I focused on DotNet for many years and it made me experienced. Although .Net has many beneficial features such as rapid development, simple debugging and windows integrations, with the passage of the time I found new opportunities in open source languages such as Python and NodeJS.
</p><p>
For the time being, I have extensive experience in developing, analyzing, designing and architecture of web-based applications on the Net platform, Python and front-end technologies such as AngularJS, Angular and ReactJS.

I was in charge of developing many solutions for industries and startups including banking, healthcare, fintech, etc.

<h1>What does mean ‘Peek Byte’?</h1>
<p>In computer science, peek is an operation on certain abstract data types, specifically sequential collections such as stacks and queues, which returns the value of the top ("front") of the collection without removing the element from the collection. </p>

<p>It thus returns the same value as operations such as "pop" or "dequeue", but does not modify the data. The name "peek" is similar to the basic "push" and "pop" operations on a stack, but the name for this operation varies depending on data type and language. Peek is generally considered an inessential operation, compared with the more basic operations of adding and removing data, and as such is not included in the basic definition of these data types. However, since it is a useful operation and generally easily implemented, it is frequently included in practice, and in some definitions peek is included as basic, with pop (or analog) defined in terms of peek; see abstract definition.
