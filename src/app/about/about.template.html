<h1>What does mean ‘Peek Byte’?</h1>
<p>In computer science, peek is an operation on certain abstract data types, specifically sequential collections such as stacks and queues, which returns the value of the top ("front") of the collection without removing the element from the collection. </p>

<p>It thus returns the same value as operations such as "pop" or "dequeue", but does not modify the data. The name "peek" is similar to the basic "push" and "pop" operations on a stack, but the name for this operation varies depending on data type and language. Peek is generally considered an inessential operation, compared with the more basic operations of adding and removing data, and as such is not included in the basic definition of these data types. However, since it is a useful operation and generally easily implemented, it is frequently included in practice, and in some definitions peek is included as basic, with pop (or analog) defined in terms of peek; see abstract definition.
